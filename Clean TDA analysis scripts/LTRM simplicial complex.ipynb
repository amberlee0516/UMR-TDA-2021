    "# TDA Analysis\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, we will use the selected parameters to run kmapper on the entire cleaned LTRM data. We will create the simplicial complex, find the states, and then color the html file by various variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this script there is options to use one of the following parameter combinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All water quality variables\n",
    "2. Removing TURB and SECCHI and only use SS\n",
    "3. Remove water clarity variables (SS, TURB, and SECCHI) and analyze only nutrient variables\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Currently, we anticipate that we will be using the following water quality variables: WDP, SS, TN, TP, VEL, CHLcal, DO. This is because TURB and SECCHI are highly correlated with SS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will first make the following alterations to the cleaned and interpolated LTRM data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scale the conintuous variable columns with RobustScaler(). Robust scaler scales the data by subtracting the median and dividing by the IQR for each continuous variable.\n",
    "2. Adding 5 decade columns with one-hot encoding\n",
    "3. Adding 3 stratum columns with one-hot encoding\n",
    "4. Adding 6 field number columns with one-hot encoding\n",
    "5. New coloring columns for each continuous variable with a lower 'ceiling' - prevents outliers from skewing the color scale\n",
    "6. New unscaled continuous variable columns \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then run kmapper with several different combinations of parameter values (epsilon, min samples, cubes, and percent overlap). Recall that we are using PCA 2 as the filter function. We will use the heuristics stated previously to choose a combination of parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The TDA analysis will include the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run kmapper on the data set\n",
    "2. Use the code written by Killan to find the density of each node in a simplicial complex\n",
    "3. Convert the simplicial complex to a directed graph with arrows pointing to a node with a higher density\n",
    "4. Local maxium will be defined as sinks of the directed graph\n",
    "5. States of a local maximum will be made up of the nodes whose shortest graph distance to a local maximum is that local maximum\n",
    "6. Color the simplicial complex by different variables to make inferences about the states in each region of the river\n",
    "7. Make boxplots of the continuous variables for each state (this final step will be completed in a different jupyter notebook)\n"

    "Since the LTRM data has so many outliers for each continous variable, the color scale for the html is skewed strongly to the right. Kmapper uses min-max color scaling meaning that the smallest value is set to the left of the scale and the largest values is set to the right of the color scale. With so many large outliers, most of the nodes are colored by the left side of the scale and thus qualitative information from coloring is lost. For examples, since there are such extreme outliers in the TN columns, the html is colored all dark purple - the low level of the scale. With this the case, it is difficult to see where the larger values of TN are in the simplicial complex. In attempt to minimize the skewedness, we will be creating new columns in which the outlier values are lowered. This will \"lower the ceiling\" of the continuous variables and allow us better distinguish differences in continuous variables across the simplicial complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be setting our ceiling to the Q75 + (3 * IQR) whereas an outlier is defined by Q75 + (1.5 * IQR). This will ensure that our extreme outliers will still be regarded as outliers, though they will not disrupt the information we can gain from the various coloring values. NOTE that this change is made souly for coloring and will not be used when we calculate statisitcal information for each state.\n",
