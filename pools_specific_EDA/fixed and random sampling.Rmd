## Summary

The LTRM water quality data is created from fixed and random sampling sites. The fixed sampling sites are different because

a) They are fixed... so the same location is sampled multiple times throughout the year

b) The fixed sampling sites are not in the main channel.

Using the data from the fixed sampling sites may not even be relevant to our TDA analysis. Being able to identify the fixed site samples is thus important.

However, identifying which samples are from fixed sites is not straightforward. Location code `LOCATCD` is not readily decipherable because there are formats that 

```{r}
